Project Overview:

Brick Breaker Game is a single-player platform game, which has, after its initial release in 1999, become a worldwide classic. In this project, this game was developed as an
end-semester university project, by two second-year students. We developed it in Python, using Pygame (https://www.pygame.org/), a free and open-source Python library, designed for 
writing video games. 

Motivations behind the Project:
1) Too tired of traditional semester projects, like Library Management Systems, or Attendance Systems, etc.
2) To develop a platform game for entertainment purposes.
3) To employ Object Oriented Programming techniques, like using modules and classes, to make the code more efficient.
4) To learn the use of Pygame Library, in game development.

Game Rules:
1) It is a single-player game, where the player must break all the tiles to win.
2) The paddle is moved along the screen to bounce the ball back towards the tiles.
3) The player has a total of three lives. They lose a life if the ball falls down the screen.
4) If the player loses all three lives, it is GAME OVER!

Possible Future Improvements:
1) More levels of playthrough.
2) Intricate designs of various levels.
3) Implementing a scoring system.
4) Increasing hitboxes of different bricks, and including various power-ups for the paddle.
